# CrystalGame

You will be given a Winning Number at the start of the game.
There are four crystals displayed on the page. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it. By clicking each crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your Current Number.

You win the game by matching your Current Number to the Winning Number. You lose the game if your Current Number goes above the Winning Number. Each time the game restarts, the value of each crystal will be re-assigned.
